This is a Proof Of Concept to relocate anywhere in the motherboard of an Amiga500 the CPU.
It consists of two PCB Adapter for Original Primary CPU Socket Adapter + a 64pin FFC/FPC cable and a Secondary CPU Socket Adapter with the add of power supply (as seen in the Molex Floppy Header Power Cable)

Will it work?? ;-P
